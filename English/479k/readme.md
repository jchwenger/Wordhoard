A text file containing over 479k English words.

While searching for a list of english words (for an auto-complete tutorial)
I found: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2213607/how-to-get-english-language-word-database which refers to [http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable](https://web.archive.org/web/20131118073324/http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/word-list-350000-simple-english-words-excel-readable) (archived).

No idea why infochimps put the word list inside an excel (.xls) file.

I pulled out the words into a simple new-line-delimited text file.
Which is more useful when building apps or importing into databases etc.

-  [479k_alpha.txt](479k_alpha.txt) and [479k_alpha.json](479k_alpha.json) contains only [[:alpha:]] words (words that only have letters, no numbers or symbols). If you want a quick solution choose this.
